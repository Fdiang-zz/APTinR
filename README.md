Arbitrage Pricing Theory in R

Hello :)

This is an implementation in R of Arbitrate Pricing Theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage_pricing_theory); which is a multi-factor asset precification method. This code was motivated by a post-graduation paper in which I had to analyze the returns on the biggest brazilian stock market (Bovespa). 

My goal is to make this as flexible as possible, so others can reuse and improve this implementation; although I'm not an experienced R programmer, I wish to be able to contribute with a starting point :)
